\section{Simulator Validation}	\label{sec:valid}
%
To validate the reliability of EBeSS, we compare the experiment results of EBeSS with an existing NVP system~\cite{Liu2015Ambient} which adopts the 2-thres scheme. 
The system parameters are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:valid-param}.
The validation compares the execution time and energy consumption with different power profiles and benchmarks.
The power profiles are real solar power traces in MIDC database from NREL Solar Radiation Research Laboratory~\cite{midc2015solar}.
By executing three benchmarks (\emph{fft}, \emph{queens} and \emph{sort}), Tab.~\ref{tab:valid-result} shows that, the difference between the simulation result (time/energy) and the measured result are is within 7.88\%/6.38\% and the average difference is 3.45\%/2.91\%.
Therefore, EBeSS is proved to have the ability of imitating the behavior of a real NVP based self-powered system prototype.
