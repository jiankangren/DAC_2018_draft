Unstable power supply is the main challenge to the existing energy harvesting systems in IoT applications. Nonvolatile processor is more and more attractive for its efficient automatic reactions which guarantee the task progress when power supply outages take place. These reactions are referred as energy behaviors. This paper proposes an instruction-level simulator, EBeSS, supporting energy behavior design exploration of both the nonvolatile processor and the peripherals in a self-powered system.  To demonstrate the capability of EBeSS, we explores the performance and energy efficiency of three existing energy management strategies with different power profiles and application types. Experiment results show that DVFS has better performance when the energy supply density is either too high or too low, and ModeCvrt is more suitable when peripherals and I/O operations dominate the system. Evaluations of EBeSS proves its potential to support more detailed optimizations and data correctness validations of the energy behavior designs in a transiently powered energy harvesting systems.
