\section{Conclusion}	\label{sec:sum}
%
Target on energy behavior design exploration, this paper proposes a NVP based energy harvesting system simulator, EBeSS, which supports flexible energy behavior configuration of both NVP and peripherals.
With the help of EBeSS, we explores the performance and energy efficiency of three existing energy behaviors with different power profiles and application types. 
The experiments shows the insights that both DVFS and ModeCvrt schemes have advantages in different power supply and application conditions.
Furthermore, EBeSS shows the potential to efficiently and correctly optimize the design parameter settings and validate the data consistency and correctness of the energy management strategies in the transiently powered energy harvesting systems.
