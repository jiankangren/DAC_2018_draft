Battery-less devices and energy harvesting techniques are more and more attractive in today's IoT area. However, the intermittent and low-intensity ambient power sources cause insecure quality of service (QoS) of these self-powered IoT applications, which makes it essential to pre-simulate the QoS of an self-powered system and its energy managing strategy under various power conditions. Unfortunately, existing simulator lacks of supports on peripherals in a self-powered system and requires great efforts to implement the hardware-based energy managing schemes, such as NVP, DVFS and near-threshold designs. 

This paper proposes EBeSS, an system-level simulator based on GEM5, supporting easy-configurable energy managing strategies on both processor and peripherals. EBeSS develops a configurable simulation object, virtual device, to support the functional and energy-related behaviors of peripherals, and energy message handling framework to support configured energy managing strategies. A real hardware prototype validates that the error of EBeSS is less that xx\%. And a self-powered system design flow is given to reveal the potential of EBeSS on exploring the design space of parameters of a self-powered system (such as capacitor and energy managing scheme) with optimal performance.
